skoope
======

Utility for Skype made in Lua.
Lua communication with Skype is set through Microsoft COM interface.

LuaJIT and modules are included in this repo, just use LAUNCH.bat to get this working.

## Running in Sandboxie ##

Afaik, COM can interact with applications running in sandboxie, so you should have no problem using skoope with it.
